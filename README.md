There are three parts to this repository which are the code sources for the three main features of the solution --- Analysis of the student, roadmapcreation, AI instructor.
These three features are currently being implemented in the prototype present as individual features(future integration into a single platform will happen soon).
Other features such as AI study assistants and audio recaps are additional ones which are currently work in progress
The prototype submitted contains the baseline working of the entire idea
